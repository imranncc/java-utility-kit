/* Final Exam (100 marks in total; 30% of the final score of this course)
 *
 * Question 1 (15 marks)
 *
 * Write a complete static method that finds the smallest value in a 2-dimension array of int.
 * The method should have one input argument, which is a 2d array of type int input by the user.
 * The smallest number in the array should be returned by the method.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: 4  6  8
 *        5  8  9
 *        2  1  8
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Marking strategy:
 *      The code to get user inputs and store them in the 2-dimension array is worth 5 marks.
 *      The code to find the smallest number in the 2-dimension array is worth 10 marks.
 *
 * Note: please feel free to use any format to let the user input the 2-dimension array
 * Note: please feel free to modify the following code.
